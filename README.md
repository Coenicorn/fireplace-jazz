# Fireplace Jazz

Plays soothing jazz while a fireplace is calmly popping and hissing in the background

I made this beceause I had a server running in my bedroom and was too addicted to my phone and wanted to remove it from the room at night.
Sadly I used it to play these kinds of sounds, so I wrote this for my server.

On my server there's a 'fireplace.wav' in the root and .wav files with jazz music in ./jazz.

It's shit I know
